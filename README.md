### What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. -->

1. Code Organization
Structured HTML:

You created a clear semantic structure using main, section, div, form, etc.
Content is properly grouped into containers (navigation, shop, summary, information), making the code easy to read and maintain.
Modular CSS:

You included a normalize.css file to standardize styles across browsers.
CSS variables (:root) were used for colors and typography, ensuring consistency and simplifying future updates.
Learning: Good file organization and adhering to conventions keep the project scalable and maintainable.

2. Responsive Design
You implemented a responsive layout using media queries:
Adjusted sections like shop, summary, and information for larger screens.
Used properties like grid-template-columns to manage layouts for various screen sizes.
Learning: Adapting designs to multiple devices enhances user experience, which is critical in modern web development.

3. Use of CSS Variables
Defined global variables (--font, --CharcoalBlack, etc.) to centralize design values such as colors and fonts.
Learning: Using CSS variables optimizes code maintenance and ensures design consistency.

4. Typography and Accessibility
Integrated custom fonts from Google Fonts (Roboto, Raleway, Inter).
Used relative units (rem, em) for scalable and accessible text.
Learning: Incorporating custom fonts and relative units improves aesthetics and accessibility.

5. Form Design
Designed a functional form with:
Proper labels (label) linked to fields (input, select).
Styled buttons (.form__submit) integrated into the overall design.
Learning: Well-structured and styled forms are essential for user-friendly input.

6. Flexbox and Grid
Utilized Flexbox and Grid Layout:
Flexbox for aligning content (product, navigation__container).
Grid for managing more complex layouts (products, shop).
Learning: Combining Flexbox and Grid enables robust and adaptive layouts.

7. Separation of Concerns
Separated content (HTML), styling (CSS), and logic (to be added, likely with JavaScript).
Learning: Following the principle of separation of concerns makes collaboration and maintenance easier.

8. Styling and UX
Applied subtle colors and shadows (box-shadow, color) to create visual hierarchies (summary, information).
Used properties like border-radius and background-color to achieve a modern and visually appealing design.
Learning: Small design details contribute significantly to the user experience.

9. Understanding Data Flow
Simulated a "checkout" flow with products and a form.
Displayed subtotal, taxes, and total dynamically (even though no JavaScript logic is implemented yet).
Learning: Structuring a logical flow prepares the project for interactive functionality.

10. Deployment Readiness
Included a favicon, pre-connected to external resources (fonts.googleapis.com), and used relative paths (css, img).
Learning: These optimizations are critical for performance and a professional deployment.
